## 🔧 Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## 🏗️ Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## 🧪 Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## 🎯 Running end-to-end tests
